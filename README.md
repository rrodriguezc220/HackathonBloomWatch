# HackathonBloomWatch
## Summary
BloomRythm is a monitoring and prediction system for flowering patterns using artificial intelligence and satellite imagery (Landsat, Sentinel). We developed a predictive model stored in AWS cloud that analyzes time series of vegetation indices (NDVI) to predict when and where plants will bloom, detecting desynchronizations caused by climate change. Climate change is breaking the synchrony between flowering and pollinators, causing million dollar losses. Globally, Poland's crops bloomed a month early in 25°C heat then -8°C frost destroyed them, costing €37 million in EU aid in 2024. In Perú, Chincha, farmers lost US$1.5 million in 2024 when climate disrupted mandarin flowering. In Cajamarca, Peru, the climate crisis mirrors this pattern: temperatures dropped to -0.3°C during June 2024 frosts, damaging crops across localities above 2,900 meters BloomRythm acts as the planet's "ecological clock," allowing farmers to anticipate flowering windows and optimize resources. With 71% of Cajamarca's territory vulnerable to extreme climate events, our system provides early warnings for biodiversity conservation and sustainable agriculture. Our cloud-based architecture enables scalability worldwide from California's almond orchards to Virginia's apple farms. Because when we protect flowering patterns, we protect life itself from the smallest pollinator to the global food security that feeds humanity.
